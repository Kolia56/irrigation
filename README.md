# irrigation

Home assistant: Irrigation unlimited and Smart irrigation integration

I'd to share the code I came to in order to automate irrigation of a 13 zones sytem that is made of:
- One lawn watered by a sprinkler
- 12 separate zones watered by drip lines

Irrigation unlimited is managing the control of all valves and the related timings, whilst HA smart irrigation is used to compute once a day the lawn watering time.
